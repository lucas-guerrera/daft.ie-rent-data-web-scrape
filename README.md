# Daft.ie Rental Property Project

Welcome to my Python project, a web scraping application designed to collect and store data from Daft.ie, Ireland's largest and most visited Real Estate website. This project focuses on gathering essential information about rental properties listed on the website, including rent prices, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, latitude, longitude, and distance from the city center.

The application performs a daily scrape of Daft.ie to ensure that the collected data is up-to-date and comprehensive. By leveraging web scraping techniques, we can efficiently gather a wide range of property details, providing valuable insights into the rental market.

Once the scraping process is complete, the project proceeds with data exploratory analysis, enabling us to uncover patterns, trends, and statistical information about the rental properties. This analysis helps us gain a deeper understanding of the market dynamics and enables us to make informed decisions.

To ensure data quality, a data cleaning process is applied, which addresses any inconsistencies or missing values within the collected dataset. By cleaning the data, we create a reliable and consistent foundation for further analysis and insights.

Finally, the project stores the cleaned and analyzed data in a local CSV file for easy access and future reference. This local storage solution allows for convenient data retrieval and utilization in various applications or further data processing.

By combining web scraping, data exploration, cleaning, and storage, this Python project provides a comprehensive solution for gathering, analyzing, and utilizing real estate rental data from Daft.ie.
